# Smart Legal Contracts NLP Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an NLP pipeline for converting natural language legal agreements into Smart Legal Contracts using the Accord Project framework. The system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline contract creation and management.

## Features

- Contract classification and similarity search
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying contract elements
- Question Answering (QA) models for extracting contract data
- Integration with Accord Project's Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo frameworks
- Web interface for reviewing and editing extracted contract elements

## Project Goals

- Develop an AI pipeline for converting natural language agreements into smart contracts
- Extend knowledge graphs and NLP techniques to improve clause classification
- Implement privacy-preserving techniques for data handling
- Establish a benchmark for smart legal contracts to foster industry collaboration
- Incorporate state-of-the-art AI models to optimize performance

## Accord Project Integration

This project works with the Accord Project's three main components:

- **Cicero**: Natural language template expression
- **Concerto**: Data modeling language
- **Ergo**: Domain-specific language for contract logic
